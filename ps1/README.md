For this assignment, explore MNIST training with a neural network with
2 hidden layers, as described here:

https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/tf/index.html

In the code: fully_connected_feed.py, note lines 36-40, which define
max_size, batch_step and number of neurons in hidden-layers 1 and 2.

Explore some of these parameters and report on your observations
(e.g. %correct vs training time).

Submit your report here (on Blackboard).

Please note: working collaboratively is acceptable at the conceptual
level and for learning about TensorFlow, but each individual should
submit their own unique exploration and report
